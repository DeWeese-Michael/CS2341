# Recursion

The facorial function is defined as:

$n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * \dots * 1$


Recursion needs:

* A base case: 1! = 1
* And a recursive call that works towards the base case.


**Notes:** 

* Recursions can be translated into an iteration and vice versa. 
* The use of recursion is supposed to create shorter and simpler code that
  can also be more efficient.
* Using recursion instead of simple iterations like calculating the factorial
  is not a good idea! A better implementation is [iterative.cpp].
