# Minimal Example Using CMake

You need a `main.cpp` or any other cpp file that contains the main function and a
`CMakeLists.txt` file. You can start by copying these into a new folder.

Open the folder in VS Code, hit `CTRL+SHIFT P` and select `CMake: Configure`. Now you are ready to compile and run the program
using the status bar.
