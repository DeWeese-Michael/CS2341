# Time Complexity Example: Bubble Sort

Set launch target to bubble_sort_timing 

## Analyze Runtime directly

1. Run `./bubble_sort_timing' and look at the output. How does the runtime increase with N?

## Analyze with Excel

1. Run `./bubble_sort_timing  > output.csv`
2. Open `output.csv` in Excel. 
3. Remove all 0s (Excel trendlines don't work with 0s).
4. Make a line chart.
5. Add a trendline (turn on the equation and R-squared).
