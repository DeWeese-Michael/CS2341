# Time Complexity Example: Sorting Algorithm Implemented in the STL

Do the same analysis that we did with [bubble sort](../bubble_sort/).

Look add [std::sort](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort) to find out about the
complexity. The algorithm is discussed [here](https://medium.com/@lucianoalmeida1/exploring-some-standard-libraries-sorting-functions-dd633f838182).
