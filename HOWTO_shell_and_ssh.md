# HOWTO Use a Shell (aka Terminal) and SSH

A [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) is a command-line interface for the operating system. Your computer also has one. 

* Popular shells on Linux are `sh` and [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).
* On Windows it is called [`PowerShell`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/).
* On Mac it is called `Terminal` (defaults to [`zsh`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)).

Most shells understand similar commands and being able to use a shell is needed to work as a computer 
scientist with cloud-based servers. Here are a [brief introduction](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) and
a short [Linux command cheat sheet.](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)

To securely log into a Unix/Linux server, the [secure shell protocol (SSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is used. It opens a shell on the server that you can use from your computer. You need a ssh client. Linux and Mac use
the client called `ssh`. A popular client for windows is [putty](https://www.putty.org/).
